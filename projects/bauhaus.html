                <p>
                    Bauhaus was a German art school founded in 1919 by Walter Gropius. It
                    emphasized the importance of functionalism, modern technology, and quality
                    craftsmanship. Bauhaus style sought to combine art and industry through form
                    following function, using simple geometric shapes and primary colors. It
                    emphasized the importance of functionalism, modern technology, and quality
                    craftsmanship. This style became popular in design, architecture, and art,
                    influencing everything from furniture to typography.

                    <p>The philosophy behind these art forms was to
                        simplify the design and focus on function and
                        efficiency. Both forms used geometric shapes and
                        precise measurements to create a harmonious
                        composition, making shapes as simple as possible
                        without sacrificing aesthetics.

                    <p>Bauhaus and Tangram played a massive role in
                    modern art and design development, and their
                    influence can still be seen in contemporary design
                    practices. Both art movements share a common goal
                    of simplicity, which is why they complement each
                    other and inspire new forms of art that carry on
                    their legacy</p>

                    <strong>Customisation:</strong> Customers can ensure their house is
                    built according to their needs and preferences,
                    making it a unique and personalised space.

                    <br>
                    <strong>Control:</strong> Being involved in the design process
                    ensures that the customer can oversee all aspects of
                    the project and make informed decisions about the
                    design and construction
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Satisfaction:</strong> Being part of the design process ensures
                    that customers are satisfied with the end product, as
                    they have input into how their house looks and feels.

                    <br>
                    <strong>Sense of ownership:</strong> Customers involved in the
                    design process feel a sense of ownership over the final
                    product, making them more invested in the house
                    and more likely to take care of it

                    <br>
                    <strong>Future-proofing:</strong>  Customers can identify potential
                    future needs and design their houses accordingly,
                    meaning they won't have to make expensive changes
                    later.
