                <h2>Some info about the chameleon</h2>
                <hr>

                <p>
                    <strong>Characteristics</strong>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Over time scientists have found out that chameleons have hundreds of
                    crystals in their skin, at least a hundred thousands in each cell. These tiny
                    crystals reflect different wavelengths of light creating different colors. So
                    by changing the distance of the Crystals, chameleons can reflect almost
                    any color possible.
                    The eyes of a chameleon can be adjusted separately. That will say they can
                    look in two directions at the same time. With each eye having a rotational
                    capacity of 180 degrees. Giving them the possibility to get a 360 degree
                    scope of their surroundings
                </p>
            </div>

                <h2>Color</h2>
                <hr>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Chameleons are ecothermal animals which means they can’t control their
                    own body heat. So having chameleons in captivity gives you the responsibility of being able to control their habitat due to their requirements. The
                    body temperature of the chameleons can be seen by looking at their colors. A cold chameleon carries darker shades of colors so they can attract
                    more sunlight. While when they are warm it changes to a lighter shade.
                    The fact that chameleons only change color as a survival instinct isn't completely correct. As mentioned, temperature is one of them as well as their
                    mood and communication. So through the color they communicate with
                    the surroundings
                </p>

                <p>
                    Chameleons are most insect eating animals. Which means that the main
                    part of their diet consists of invertebrate animals with six legs. For example grasshoppers, nocturnal butterflies, bugs and crickets.
                    The most striking feature of these reptiles is their retractable tongue that
                    they project over long distances to catch their prey in only 0,07 seconds.
                    Cockroaches are the main diet of chameleons in captivity, as well as crickets and worms. Chameleons just eat living insects due to them trusting
                    their prey’s movements to hunt.

                    <h2>Habitat inspiration</h2>
                    <hr>

                    <p>
                        At first, we wanted to create a design for a chameleon as a household pet. However,
                        after further research, we discovered chameleons are very temperament animals,
                        sensitive to their space, surroundings and constant human interactions.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        We wanted to create a natural habitat for the chameleon. We took inspiration from
                        the pictures to the right. The inter action between the greenery and house design
                        intertwined so that nothing was disturbed. The idea of a Home within a home, in this
                        case, the chameleon habitat, has its own home within the owner’s home, still allowing for interaction between the humans and the user, the chameleon, yet keeping
                        that to a minimal level
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A cylindrical shape allows less of a constraint than a box shape. The circular design allows more natural light to be shed in the habitat, which is now
                        our aim. The open roof enables natural light to come out of the day. The
                        surface area for this design was more significant than the ideas under the
                        stairs; this allowed the chameleon to have a larger living space. Chameleons
                        require things to climb on and around. Branches and vines can create a
                        jungle-like atmosphere, so the more space we have, the better
                    </p>

                    <br>
                    <p>With our cylindrical design, the irrigation and light systems are already in
                    place; in our case, we want to have dripping irrigation around the habitat;
                    this is because chameleons do not simply drink from a body of water; they
                    need a “rain-type” of the environment when it comes to their water supply
                    as that is how they drink. With that in mind, the plumbing systems placed
                    on the roof work to our advantage. We decided to make the roof surface
                    slightly more minor yet still allow light to go in because the water and light
                    systems need to create a more natural atmosphere. For example, the water
                    supply can’t drain onto the sides of the habitat but is more in the centre.
                    As for the lighting systems, chameleons require UVB lighting to obtain
                    Vitamin D3, which aids in calcium absorption. There will be placements
                    of warm yellow lights equivalent to a 5.0 UVB light bulb.</p>
