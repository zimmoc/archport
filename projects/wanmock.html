                    The dog bed is adapted to the size of the breed. With a height of 41 cm, making it easy for the breed to jump, climb into it no matter what age.

The Wanmock as it is called comes from the thought of creating an "hammock"
out of wood. Two ideas that combined creates the name Wanmock.
<br>
<br>
To create this hammock the designers have chosen to work with a wooden
structure as base and a t shirt as the textile. The t shirt can be an old one found
in the wardrobe as well as a thicker one in the time of cool temperatures.
<br>
<br>
Due to the smart design the T-shirt can easily be exchanged and washed when
needed. The T-shirt make the dogs feel surrounded and protected by holding
the dog from both sides making it cosy and safe.

                        The Wanmock dog bed is put together as puzzle pieces. Easy to assemble and easy to deconstruct. Wanmock gives the owner the possibility
                        to bring, move and tuck away the bed if necessary.

                        <br>
                        The wanmock dog bed is constructed with the technique of wood joinery. Wich easifys the assembly by not having to use any tools or extra
                        components. The only thing needed is the wood pieces and an t-shirt.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The wood joinery technique used is the “half - lap joint”. Which is where
                        half of each of the two boards being joined is removed so that the two
                        boards join together flush with one another. In half lap joints the boards
                        are of the same thickness and half the thickness of each one removed
